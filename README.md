  This lab was for DIG4714 (Intermediate Game Development) <br> and it was a practice in committing, merging, and creating multiple branches <br> with different origins. <br><br>
  Our goal for this assignment was to recreate the following graph: 
    <br><br>
      <img src="github_graph.png" width="465" height="320"> 
    <br><br>
  During this assignment, I had to revert to a previous commit <br> since I had messed up the flow of the activity; <br> before making the "feature 1" branch, I had already made the <br> second develop commit. <br><br>
  Because of this, I had to revert to when I first created the branch. <br> I learned how to use <b>git reset</b> by doing this though, so it was a valuable experience!
